### >â—Ž//: Greetings Programs! ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm Ryan, sometimes my friends call me Spargo. I'm a professional web engineer and novice game developer.

## ðŸ”­ What Iâ€™m currently working on:
I've really been trying to expand my coding knowledge by trying to make small games for different platforms/libraries. While I'm still taking baby steps now, I would love to enter some game jams in the future.
## ðŸ’¡ What I'm currently learning:
Playdate SDK; Going from making small demo games in JavaScript and PICO-8, the shift to working on the Playdate shares some similarities, but brings with it a lot of unknowns that have presented quite an interesting challenge. I really do think the Playdate is a nifty little indie device, so I want to make quite a few games for it!
## ðŸŽ® Other Hobbies:
- I love to play video games and tabletop games. I've been a Nintendo-head since before I could remember, but I play on a wide range of platforms. My favorite genre is rouge-like.
- I play pinball semi-competetively. Casual play to beat my high scores is always more low-pressure and fun, but I've met some great people doing local tournaments and have relly felt myself improve.
- I like to draw and do graphic design. I recently designed Disney Lorcana playmats for me and my girlfriend.
- I sometimes stream on Twitch.
## âš¡ Fun facts:
- I have over 1000 hours logged in The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth and it's where my cat Guppy gets his name!
