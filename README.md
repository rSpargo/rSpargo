### >◎//: Greetings Programs! 👋 

I'm Ryan Spargo; a professional web developer and hobbyist graphic designer/game developer!

## 🔭 What I’m currently working on:
Making a ton of templates and automations for tracking progress on projects and personal goals/notes with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). It's really helped organize my thoughts and I recommend everyone give it a try. I've got a plug-in in the works that essentially integrates Scryfall into your vault so you can track any kind of MtG card/deck in your vault.
## 💡 What I'm currently learning:
In terms of programming: [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/). Really trying to make more and more interfaces and make a more public identity for myself and Solid seemed like a great approach for that. Currently, it feels a lot like having all of the benefits/QOL of React, but perfect for situations that you don't need all of React's muscles.

Outside of programming: I'm getting super into learning Ableton and music production! 🎚️🎛️🎹🎶
## 🎮 Other Hobbies:
- 🎮🎲 Games; Love playing video games *and* tabletop games solo or with my wife. I also love coming up with small game ideas to make for PICO-8 and the Playdate.
- 🎨 Graphic Design/Art; I primarily do personal projects, but I'd love to start doing freelance work and making convention buyables some day!
## ⚡ Fun facts:
- I have 3 cats: Guppy, Eleanor, and Homer 🐱
- A piece of my art has been tattooed on someone's arm!
- If I could have *any* job, I'd specifically want to work for Disney on a team soely responsible for bringing new TRON-related projects to life.
